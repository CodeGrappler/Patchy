                <h3>Proxying Torrent Traffic</h3>
                <p>Patchy supports torrenting over a SOCKSv5 proxy. The only traffic that will actually be proxied is peer-to-peer traffic.
                There are a few things to take note of here:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tracker traffic is not proxied, and still uses HTTP or UDP directly.</li>
                    <li>The proxy does not add additional encryption - make sure you set your encryption preferences in the
                    bittorrent tab if you'd like your peer-to-peer traffic to be encrypted.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea">Torrenting over TOR is a bad idea</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's important to note that using a proxy does not increase your privacy. Patchy (and most other bittorrent clients) will send
                your IP address to peers, thus comprimising your privacy. You should consider using a more sophisticated solution if you wish
                to obsfucate your IP address. Using a proxy will also likely slow down your downloads, and you might not be given credit where
                it's due if your tracker requires a high seeding ratio.</p>
