                <h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
                <p>Patchy supports adding torrents based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular
                expressions</a> in RSS feeds. These are powerful expressions that allow you to be quite specific with which
                torrents are added and which are discarded. It is suggested that you spend some time reading about them on
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Wikipedia</a>, or other sources, but here's a really
                simple crash course:</p>
                <p>Say you want to add new episodes of the TV show "foo bar" as they're released. You know the torrent name
                will be something like "Foo Bar S<strong>#</strong>E<strong>#</strong>". The following regex would match it:</p>
                <pre>Foo Bar S[0-9]+E[0-9]+</pre>
                <p>This looks for "Foo Bar S", and then at least one character between 0 and 9 (<code>[0-9]+</code>), one for
                season, one for episode.</p>
                <p>Another example: you want the latest album by "That One Group". You know the torrent will be named something
                like "That One Group - <strong>Album Name</strong>". You could use this regex:</p>
                <pre>That One Group - [A-Z ]+</pre>
                <p>This will match on "That One Group - ", and then at least one letter or space (<code>[A-Z ]+</code>).</p>
                <p>If you just want <em>everything</em> from a certain RSS feed, use "<code>.*</code>". Be careful with this one.</p>
                <p>If you're in doubt, regex will also match most normal text. So, "Foo Bar" would match anything with
                "Foo Bar" in the title. There are a few special characters you cannot use - see the Wikipedia page. You can
                still use these characters if you escape them, like this: "\."</p>
                <p>Notes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Patchy regexes are not case-sensitive</li>
                    <li>^ and $ are not added automatically</li>
                </ul>
